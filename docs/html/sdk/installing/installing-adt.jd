<p>Android offers a custom plugin for the Eclipse IDE, called Android
Development Tools (ADT). This plugin is designed to give you a powerful, integrated
environment in which to develop Android apps. It extends the capabilites
of Eclipse to let you quickly set up new Android projects, build an app
UI, debug your app, and export signed (or unsigned) app packages (APKs) for distribution.
</p>

<p>If you will be developing in Eclipse with the ADT Plugin, first make sure that you have a
suitable version of Eclipse
installed on your computer as described by the 
<a href="{@docRoot}sdk/index.html#Requirements">system requirements</a>.</p>

<p>If you need to install Eclipse, you can download it from <a href=
"http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/">http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/</a>.
We recommend the "Eclipse Classic" version. Otherwise, you should use a Java or
RCP version of Eclipse.</p>


<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> If you prefer to work in a different IDE, you do not need to
install Eclipse or ADT. Instead, you can directly use the SDK tools to build and
debug your application. So if you're not using Eclipse, continue to the next page by clicking
the <strong>Next</strong> link on the right.</p>



<h2 id="Download">Download the ADT Plugin</h2>


<ol>
    <li>Start Eclipse, then select <strong>Help</strong> &gt; <strong>Install New
Software...</strong>.</li>
    <li>Click <strong>Add</strong>, in the top-right corner.</li>
    <li>In the Add Repository dialog that appears, enter "ADT Plugin" for the <em>Name</em> and the
following URL for the <em>Location</em>:
      <pre>https://dl-ssl.google.com/android/eclipse/</pre>
    </li>
    <li>Click <strong>OK</strong>
      <p>Note: If you have trouble acquiring the plugin, try using "http" in the Location URL,
instead of "https" (https is preferred for security reasons).</p></li>
    <li>In the Available Software dialog, select the checkbox next to Developer Tools and click
<strong>Next</strong>.</li>
    <li>In the next window, you'll see a list of the tools to be downloaded. Click
<strong>Next</strong>. </li>
    <li>Read and accept the license agreements, then click <strong>Finish</strong>.
      <p>Note: If you get a security warning saying that the authenticity or validity of
the software can't be established, click <strong>OK</strong>.</p></li>
    <li>When the installation completes, restart Eclipse. </li>
</ol>




<h2 id="Configure">Configure the ADT Plugin</h2>

<p>After you've installed ADT and restarted Eclipse, you
  must specify the location of your Android SDK directory:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Select <strong>Window</strong> &gt; <strong>Preferences...</strong> to open the Preferences
        panel (on Mac OS X, select <strong>Eclipse</strong> &gt; <strong>Preferences</strong>).</li>
    <li>Select <strong>Android</strong> from the left panel.</li>
      <p>You may see a dialog asking whether you want to send usage statistics to Google. If so,
make your choice and click <strong>Proceed</strong>.</p>
    <li>For the <em>SDK Location</em> in the main panel, click <strong>Browse...</strong> and
        locate your downloaded Android SDK directory (such as <code>android-sdk-windows</code>).</li>
    <li>Click <strong>Apply</strong>, then <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
</ol>


<p>If you haven't encountered any errors, you're done setting up ADT
  and can continue to the next step of the SDK installation.</p>




<h2 id="Updating">Updating the ADT Plugin</h2>

<p>From time to time, a new revision of the ADT Plugin becomes available, with
new features and bug fixes. Generally, when a new revision of ADT is available,
you should update to it as soon as convenient. </p>

<p>In some cases, a new revision of ADT will have a dependency on a specific
revision of the Android SDK Tools. If such dependencies exist, you will need to
update the SDK Tools package of the SDK after installing the new revision of
ADT. To update the SDK Tools package, use the Android SDK Manager, as
described in <a href="{@docRoot}sdk/exploring.html">Exploring the SDK</a>.</p>

<p>To learn about new features of each ADT revision and also any dependencies on
the SDK Tools, see the listings in the <a href="#notes">Revisions</a>
section. To determine the version currently installed, open the
Eclipse Installed Software window using <strong>Help</strong>
&gt; <strong>Software Updates</strong> and refer to the version listed for
"Android Development Tools".</p>

<p>Follow the steps below to check whether an update is available and, if so,
to install it. </p>

<ol>
    <li>Select <strong>Help</strong> &gt; <strong>Check for Updates</strong>.
      <p>If there are no updates available, a dialog will say so and you're done.</p></li>
    <li>If there are updates available, select Android DDMS, Android Development Tools,
      and Android Hierarchy Viewer, then click <strong>Next</strong>.</li>
    <li>In the Update Details dialog, click <strong>Next</strong>.</li>
    <li>Read and accept the license agreement and then click <strong>Finish</strong>.
      This will download and install the latest version of Android DDMS and
      Android Development Tools.</li>
    <li>Restart Eclipse.</li>
</ol>


<p>If you encounter problems during the update, remove the existing ADT plugin from Eclipse, then
perform a fresh installation, using the instructions for <a href="#installing">Installing the ADT
Plugin</a>.</p>



<h2 id="Troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>

<p> If you are having trouble downloading the ADT plugin after following the
steps above, here are some suggestions: </p>

<ul>
  <li>If Eclipse can not find the remote update site containing the ADT plugin,
try changing the remote site URL to use http, rather than https. That is, set
the Location for the remote site to:
<pre>http://dl-ssl.google.com/android/eclipse/</pre></li>
<li>If you are behind a firewall (such as a corporate firewall), make sure that
you have properly configured your proxy settings in Eclipse. In Eclipse,
you can configure proxy information from the main Eclipse menu in
<strong>Window</strong> (on Mac OS X, <strong>Eclipse</strong>) &gt;
<strong>Preferences</strong> &gt; <strong>General</strong> &gt; <strong>Network
Connections</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p> If you are still unable to use Eclipse to download the ADT plugin as a
remote update site, you can download the ADT zip file to your local machine and
manually install it:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Download the current ADT Plugin zip file from the table below (do not unpack it).

  <table class="download">
    <tr>
      <th>Name</th>
      <th>Package</th>
      <th>Size</th>
      <th>MD5 Checksum</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>ADT {@adtZipVersion}</td>
    <td>
      <a href="http://dl.google.com/android/{@adtZipDownload}">{@adtZipDownload}</a>
    </td>
    <td>{@adtZipBytes} bytes</td>
    <td>{@adtZipChecksum}</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</li>

</li>
  <li>Follow steps 1 and 2 in the <a href="#installing">default install
      instructions</a> (above).</li>
  <li>In the Add Site dialog, click <strong>Archive</strong>.</li>
  <li>Browse and select the downloaded zip file.</li>
  <li>Enter a name for the local update site (e.g.,
      "Android Plugin") in the "Name" field.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>OK</strong>.
  <li>Follow the remaining procedures as listed for
      <a href="#installing">default installation</a> above,
      starting from step 4.</li>
</ol>

<p>To update your plugin once you've installed using the zip file, you will have
to follow these steps again instead of the default update instructions.</p>

<h4>Other install errors</h4>

<p>Note that there are features of ADT that require some optional
Eclipse packages (for example, WST). If you encounter an error when
installing ADT, your Eclipse installion might not include these packages.
For information about how to quickly add the necessary packages to your
Eclipse installation, see the troubleshooting topic
<a href="{@docRoot}resources/faq/troubleshooting.html#installeclipsecomponents">ADT
Installation Error: "requires plug-in org.eclipse.wst.sse.ui"</a>.</p>

<h4>For Linux users</h4>
<p>If you encounter this error when installing the ADT Plugin for Eclipse:
<pre>
An error occurred during provisioning.
Cannot connect to keystore.
JKS</pre>
<p>
...then your development machine lacks a suitable Java VM. Installing Sun
Java 6 will resolve this issue and you can then reinstall the ADT
Plugin.</p>
