<p>Android Development Tools (ADT) is a plugin for the Eclipse IDE
that is designed to give you a powerful, integrated environment in which
to build Android applications.</p>

<p>ADT extends the capabilities of Eclipse to let you quickly set up new Android
projects, create an application UI, add packages based on the Android
Framework API, debug your applications using the Android SDK tools, and even
export signed (or unsigned) {@code .apk} files in order to distribute your application.</p>

<p>Developing in Eclipse with ADT is highly recommended and is the fastest way
to get started. With the guided project setup it provides, as well as tools
integration, custom XML editors, and debug output pane, ADT gives you an
incredible boost in developing Android applications. </p>

<p>This document provides step-by-step instructions on how to download the ADT
plugin and install it into your Eclipse development environment. Note that
before you can install or use ADT, you must have compatible versions of both the
Eclipse IDE and the Android SDK installed. For details, make sure to read <a
href="{@docRoot}sdk/installing/installing-adt.html">Installing the Eclipse
Plugin</a>. </p>

<p>If you are already using ADT, this document also provides instructions on
how to update ADT to the latest version or how to uninstall it, if necessary.
</p>

<p>For information about the features provided by the ADT plugin, such as code
editor features, SDK tool integration, and the graphical layout editor (for drag-and-drop layout
editing), see the <a href="{@docRoot}tools/help/adt.html">Android Developer Tools</a>
document.</p>


<h2 id="notes">Revisions</h2>

<p>The sections below provide notes about successive releases of
the ADT Plugin, as denoted by revision number. </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Added new perspective view and tools for tracing OpenGL calls for an application and

        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Lint
        <ul>
          <li>Added new Lint rules for manifest registrations, duplicate activity
registrations, security checking, correct use of Toast, missing SharedPreferences commit()
calls, Fragment class instantiation, and handler leaks.</li>

        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Layout Editor (<a href="http://tools.android.com/recent/newlayouteditorpropertysheet">more
info</a>)
        <ul>
          <li>Added highlighting (in bold) for important attributes, inline preview of colors and
images, including the corresponding resource name.</li>
          <li>Added display of default values, when available.</li>
          <li>Added completion of resource values and enum and flag constants.</li>
          <li>Added support for displaying advanced properties, and nested properties for better
categorization, for example, layout params are listed first as a single nested property.</li>
          <li>Display Tooltips over the attribute names, not values, so they never obscure the value
column.</li>
          <li>Provided checkbox support for boolean values.</li>
          <li>Added support for switching between alphabetical and natural sort orders.</li>
          <li>Improved layout editor tool's window management for more usable editing views.</li>

          <li>Added go to declaration support for theme references (?android:attr, ?attr:).</li>
          <li>Improved code completion in style definitions.</li>
          <li>Improved code completion for the {@code minSdkVersion} and {@code targetSdkVersion}
attributes in manifest files so that version descriptions are displayed for each of the API
levels</li>
          <li>Provided support for code completion of custom attributes for custom views,
including current edits to the style files.</li>
          <li>Improved synchronization of text and graphic editors with the XML outline view,
including outline changes and display of current selection.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Build System
        <ul>
          <li>Added automatic merging of library project manifest files into the including
project's manifest. Enable this feature with the {@code manifestmerger.enabled} property.</li>
          <li>Added automatic ProGuard support for the {@code aapt -G} flag. This change causes
the build system to generate a temporary ProGuard keep-rules file containing classes that
are referenced from XML files (such as custom views) and pass this to ProGuard at shrink-time. This
can make the resulting APK much smaller when using just a small portion of a large library project
(such as the Android Support library), since the catch-all rules to keep all custom views from the
default ProGuard configuration file have also been removed.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Added support building and debugging NDK-based Android projects.</li>
      </li>
      <li>Added support to the Asset Studio Wizard for padding and turning off background
shapes.</li>
      <li>Improved LogCat to allow developers to set colors for different priorities.</li>
      <li>Improved app Run functionality to allow running on multiple devices with a single launch.
The target tab in the launch configuration dialog includes an option to allow launching on all
connected devices, with the option to further narrow the list to just physical devices or just
emulators. (This feature is available only for Run configurations, and not for Debug or JUnit
tests.)</li>

flag code issues.</li>
      <li>Fixed several bugs in the layout editor.</li>

ADT 17.0.0</a> <em>(March 2012)</em>

      <li>Java 1.6 or higher is required for ADT 17.0.0.</li>

      Manager to do so.</li>
    </ul>
  </dd>

  <dt>General improvements:</dt>
  <dd>
    <ul>
      <li>New build features
        <ul>
          <li>Added feature to automatically setup JAR dependencies. Any {@code .jar} files in the
          {@code /libs} folder are added to the build configuration (similar to how the Ant build
          system works). Also, {@code .jar} files needed by library projects are also automatically
          added to projects that depend on those library projects.
          (<a href="http://tools.android.com/recent/dealingwithdependenciesinandroidprojects">more
          info</a>)</li>
          <li>Added a feature that allows you to run some code only in debug mode. Builds now
generate a class called {@code BuildConfig} containing a {@code DEBUG} constant that is
automatically set according to your build type. You can check the ({@code BuildConfig.DEBUG})
constant in your code to run debug-only functions.</li>
          <li>Added support for custom views with custom attributes in libraries. Layouts using
custom attributes must use the namespace URI {@code http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto} instead
of the URI that includes the app package name. This URI is replaced with the app specific one at
build time.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Improved Lint features. See the <a href="{@docRoot}tools/sdk/tools-notes.html">SDK Tools r17</a>
release notes.</li>
      <li>Improved the Lint user interface
        <ul>
          <li>Added <strong>Run Lint</strong> toolbar action with a dropdown menu for selecting
specific (or all) projects, clearing results and other actions.</li>
          <li>Updated the results window to be organized as a tree rather than a flat list. Each
issue type has a single top level item, which makes it easier to quickly scan through the reported
issues and narrow down to the issues you are most interested in.</li>
          <li>Added many new toolbar actions to the results window, including expand/collapse,
ignore in file, ignore in project, ignore everywhere, show options, and configure columns.</li>
          <li>Added new column options for the <strong>Lint Warnings</strong> tab, such as
category, priority, project, file and line. The column selection (as well as the column sizes) are
persisted. You can also click on columns to sort by those values.</li>
          <li>Added Enable All and Disable All buttons to the Lint Options dialog, and a search
filter textbox to filter by issue id, summary and severity.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Added Quick Outline for XML editors (Ctrl-O, Command-O). This feature shows the structure
of the current file including icons and ids, lets you filter and quickly jump to specific ids.</li>
      <li>Updated the resource chooser to shows the resolved value for resources. For example,
when selecting {@code @string/hello} the chooser displays a resolved value such as "Hello World").
The resource chooser also now allows you to edit the chosen value directly.</li>
      <li>Updated Layout Editor so that it does not assign default ids to layouts, includes and
merge tags. This behavior tended to pollute the namespace with a lot of unused resources since
layouts are not usually manipulated via code, or referenced from XML. (The RelativeLayout editor
automatically assigns ids to views without ids when pointing to them.)</li>
      <li>Added ability to export screenshots from the Layout Editor</li>
    </ul>
  </dd>

  <dt>Bug fixes:</dt>
  <dd>
    <ul>
      <li>Fixed problem using Layout Editor with {@link android.widget.SlidingDrawer} which could
        not be dragged into the layout on some platforms.</li>
      <li>Fixed preview rendering for {@link android.widget.SlidingDrawer} and
        {@link android.widget.TabHost}.
        (<a href="http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=23022">Issue 23022</a>).</li>
      <li>Fixed issues that could prevent layout rendering due to unresolvable resources.
        (<a href="http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=21046">Issue 21046</a>,
        <a href="http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=21051">Issue 21051</a>)</li>
      <li>Fixed a bug in resource chooser which made some types of framework resources impossible to
select. (<a href="http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=20589">Issue 20589</a>)</li>
      <li>Fixed a bug in the formatter where a certain whitespace pattern could result in a
        non-space character getting deleted.
        (<a href="http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=23940">Issue 23940</a>)</li>
      <li>Fixed a locale bug affecting Turkish locales in particular.
        (<a href="http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=23747">Issue 23747</a>)</li>
      <li>Fixed issue where dex complains about duplicate classes in cases where a Library
        Project depends on the same jar files or Java-only projects.</li>
      <li>Fixed issue where test projects had to independently reference the library projects used
        by an app project. Now referencing only the app project is enough.</li>

site</a>.</p>
</dd>

<dt>General improvements:</dt>
<dd>
  <ul>


<li>Added a Welcome Wizard to help with the initial setup of the Android
development environment (<a href="http://tools.android.com/recent/welcomewizard">more
info</a>).</li>
<li>Integrated the Android Asset Studio, which helps you create icons for things
like the launcher, menus, and tabs. (<a
href="http://tools.android.com/recent/assetstudiointegration">more
info</a>).</li>
<li>Revamped the Logcat view and added support to display and filter logs by
   application names as well as PIDs (<a
   href="http://tools.android.com/recent/updatedlogcatviewer">more info</a>).</li>
<li>Revamped the SDK Manager UI (<a href="http://tools.android.com/recent/newsdkmanager">more
info</a>).</li>
<li>Revamped the New Project and the New XML File wizards to have
multiple pages. Sample projects are now copied into the workspace such that they can be modified
and deleted without affecting the master copy
(<a href="http://tools.android.com/recent/revampedwizards">more info</a>).</li>
<li>Removed the dependency on Eclipse GEF.</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<dt>XML and Java editors:</dt>
<dd>
  <ul>
    <li>Added a new XML formatter that formats all XML files according to the
   standard Android coding style. The formatter can also reorder
   attributes to follow a recommended order and processes any changes made in the Layout editor.
(<a href="http://tools.android.com/recent/xmlformatter">more info</a>).</li>
  <li>Added the "Go to Matching" (Ctrl-Shift-P) feature, which lets you jump
between opening and closing tags in XML files.</li>
  <li>Added support for the "Select Enclosing Element" feature on Mac.</li>
  <li>Added a Quickfix for extracting Strings when the caret is inside a String (<a href="">see
more</a>).</li>
  <li>Improved "smart indent", which allows automatic indentation and un-indentation
   when pressing the Return key in XML editors (<a
href="http://tools.android.com/recent/xmleditingimprovements">more info</a>).</li>

  </ul>
</dd>

<dt>Layout editor:</dt>
<dd>
  <ul>
    <li>Added tooltip feedback for dragging and resizing operations. For
    example, when dragging in a relative layout, the proposed
    constraints are shown. When resizing, the new dimensions are
    shown (<a href="http://tools.android.com/recent/layouteditorfeedbacktooltips">more
info</a>).</li>
    <li>Added the ability to suppress rendering fidelity warnings (<a
href="http://tools.android.com/recent/suppressrenderwarnings">more info</a>).</li>
    <li>Added "Remove Container" visual refactoring that removes the
    children of a container up to the top level and transfers
    namespace and layout attributes if necessary (<a
href="http://tools.android.com/recent/removecontainervisualrefactoring">more info</a>).</li>
    <li>Added pull-right menus to the context menu for accessing
    properties of the parents, which is useful when the children fully
    cover the parent and make it hard to select on their own.</li>
     <li>Improved access to properties in the context menu. The most
    frequently set attributes for each view are listed at the top of
    the menu. The Properties menu offers access to the most
    recently set attributes, attributes organized by their defining
    view, and layout attributes only or all attributes alphabetically (<a
href="http://tools.android.com/recent/layouteditorcontextmenuimprovements">more info</a>).</li>
  </ul>
</dd>

<dt>Bug fixes:</dt>
<dd>Fixed many bugs and added <a
href="http://tools.android.com/recent/miscellaneousrecentfixes">minor improvements</a>, in
particular some <a href="http://tools.android.com/recent/linuxfixes">critical bug fixes on
Linux</a>.</dd>

ADT 12.0.0</a> <em>(July 2011)</em>
  <div class="toggleme">
<dl>

<dt>Dependencies:</dt>

<dd>ADT 12.0.0 is designed for use with <a href="{@docRoot}tools/sdk/tools-notes.html">SDK Tools r12</a>. If you haven't
already installed SDK Tools r12 into your SDK, use
the Android SDK Manager to do so.</dd>

<dt>Visual Layout Editor:</dt>
<dd>
<ul>
  <li>New RelativeLayout drop support with guideline suggestions for
   attachments and cycle prevention
   (<a href="http://tools.android.com/recent/revampedrelativelayoutsupport">more info</a>).</li>
  <li>Resize support in most layouts along with
  guideline snapping to the sizes dictated by <code>wrap_content</code> and <code>match_parent</code>.
  In LinearLayout, sizes are mapped to weights instead of pixel widths.
  (<a href="http://tools.android.com/recent/resizesupport">more info</a>).</li>
  <li>Previews of drawables and colors in the resource chooser dialogs
  (<a href="http://tools.android.com/recent/imageandcolorpreviews">more info</a>).</li>
  <li>Improved error messages and links for rendering errors including
  detection of misspelled class names
  (<a href="http://tools.android.com/recent/improvedrenderingerrordiagnostics">more info</a>).</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<dt>Build system:</dt>
<dd>
<ul>
  <li id="build-option">A new option lets you disable the packaging step in the automatic
  builders. This improves performance when saving files by not
  performing a full build, which can take a long time for large projects.
  If the option is enabled, the APK is packaged when the
  application is deployed to a device or emulator or when the
  release APK is exported (<a href="http://tools.android.com/recent/finercontroloveradtbuildprocess">more info</a>).</li>

ADT 11.0.0</a> <em>(June 2011)</em>
  <div class="toggleme">

<dl>

<dt>Dependencies:</dt>

<dd>ADT 11.0.0 is designed for use with SDK Tools r11. If you haven't
already installed SDK Tools r11 into your SDK, use the Android SDK Manager to do
so.</dd>

<dt>Visual Refactoring:</dt>
<dd>
  <ul>
    <li>"Extract Style" feature pulls out style-related attributes from your layout and extracts
them as a new style defined in {@code styles.xml} (<a
href="http://tools.android.com/recent/extractstylerefactoring">more info</a>).</li>
    <li>"Wrap in Container" feature lets you select a group of views then surround them
    in a new layout (a new view group, such as a LinearLayout), and transfers namespace and layout
    parameters to the new parent (<a
href="http://tools.android.com/recent/newrefactoringswrapinchangelayoutchangewidget">more
info</a>).</li>
    <li>"Change Layout" feature changes layouts from one type
    to another, and can also flatten a layout hierarchy (<a
href="http://tools.android.com/recent/newrefactoringswrapinchangelayoutchangewidget">more
info</a>).</li>
    <li>"Change Widget Type" feature changes the type of the
    selected views to a new type. Also, a new selection context menu
    in the visual layout editor makes it easy to select siblings as
    well as views anywhere in the layout that have the same type (<a
href="http://tools.android.com/recent/newrefactoringswrapinchangelayoutchangewidget">more
info</a>).</li>
    <li>"Extract as Include" feature finds identical collections of views
    in other layouts and offers to combine them into a single layout that you can then include in
 each layout (<a
href="http://tools.android.com/recent/extractasincludeimprovements">more info</a>).</li>
    <li>Quick Assistant in Eclipse can be invoked
    from the XML editor (with Ctrl-1) to apply any of the above
    refactorings (and Extract String) to the current selection (<a
href="http://tools.android.com/recent/refactoringquickassistant">more info</a>).</li>
  </ul>
</dd>

<dt>Visual Layout Editor:</dt>
<dd>
  <ul>
    <li>This is the update to the layout editor you've been waiting for! It includes (almost) all
the goodies demonstrated at Google I/O. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oq05KqjXTvs">Watch
the video</a> on YouTube.</li>
    <li>The palette now supports different configurations for supported widgets. That is, a single
view is presented in various different configurations that you can drag into your layout. For
example, there is a <em>Text Fields</em> palette category where you can drag an {@link
android.widget.EditText} widget in as a password field, an e-mail field, a phone field, or other
types of text boxes. Similarly, {@link android.widget.TextView} widgets are preconfigured
with large, normal and small theme sizes, and {@link android.widget.LinearLayout} elements are
preconfigured in horizontal and vertical configurations (<a
href="http://tools.android.com/recent/multipletextfieldandlayouttypes">more info</a>).</li>
    <li>The palette supports custom views. You can pick up any custom
    implementations of the View class you've created in your project or from included libraries and
drag them into your layout (<a
href="http://tools.android.com/recent/customviewsinthepalette">more info</a>).</li>
    <li>Fragments are available in the palette for placement in your layout. In the tool, you can
choose which layout to show rendered for a given fragment tag. Go to declaration works for fragment
classes (<a href="http://tools.android.com/recent/fragmentsupport">more info</a>).</li>
    <li>The layout editor automatically applies a "zoom to fit" for newly
    opened files as well as on device size and orientation changes to
    ensure that large layouts are always fully visible unless you
    manually zoom in.</li>
    <li>You can drop in an {@code &lt;include&gt;} element from the palette, which will pop up
    a layout chooser. When you select the layout to include, it is added with an {@code
&lt;include&gt;}. Similarly, dropping images or image buttons will pop up image
    resource choosers (<a
href="http://tools.android.com/recent/includetagdropsupport">more info</a>).</li>
    <li>The configuration chooser now applies the "Render Target" and
    "Locale" settings project wide, making it trivial to check the
    layouts for different languages or render targets without having
    to configure these individually for each layout.</li>
    <li>The layout editor is smarter about picking a default theme to
    render a layout with, consulting factors like theme registrations
    in the manifest, the SDK version, and other factors.</li>
    <li>The layout editor is smarter about picking a default configuration to render a layout
with, defaulting to the currently visible configuration in the previous file. It also considers the
SDK target to determine whether to default to a tablet or phone screen size.</li>
    <li>Basic focus support. The first text field dropped in a layout is assigned focus, and there
are <strong>Request Focus</strong> and <strong>Clear Focus</strong> context menu items on text
fields to change the focus.</li>
  </ul>
</dd>

<dt>XML editors:</dt>
<dd>
<ul>
  <li>Code completion has been significantly improved. It now works
  with {@code &lt;style&gt;} elements, completes dimensional units,
  sorts resource paths in values based on the attribute name, and more. There are also many fixes to
handle text replacement (<a
href="http://tools.android.com/recent/xmlcodecompletionimprovements">more info</a>).</li>
  <li>AAPT errors are handled better. They are now underlined for the
  relevant range in the editor, and a new quickfix makes it trivial
  to create missing resources.</li>
  <li>Code completion for drawable, animation and color XML files (<a
href="http://tools.android.com/recent/codecompletionfordrawablescolorsandanimationfiles">more
info</a>).</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<dt>DDMS:</dt>
<dd>
<ul>
  <li>"New Folder" action in the File Explorer.</li>
  <li>The screenshot dialog will add timestamps to the filenames and preserve the orientation on
snapshot refresh.</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<dt>General notes:</dt>
<dd>
  <ul>
    <li>TraceView supports zooming with the mouse-wheel in the timeline.</li>
    <li>The New Android Project wizard now supports Eclipse working sets.</li>
  </ul>

<dt>General notes:</dt>
<dd>
  <ul>
  <li>The tools now automatically generate Java Programming Language source files (in the <code>gen/</code> directory) and
    bytecode (in the <code>res/raw/</code> directory) from your <code>.rs</code> files.</li>
  <li>A Binary XML editor has been added (<a href="http://tools.android.com/recent/binaryxmleditor">details</a>).</li>
  <li>Traceview is now integrated into the Eclipse UI (<a href="http://tools.android.com/recent/traceviewineclipse">details</a>).</li>
  <li>The "Go To Declaration" feature for XML and <code>.java</code> files quickly show all the matches in the project
  and allows you jump to specific items such as string translations or <code>onClick</code> handlers
  (<a href="http://tools.android.com/recent/gotodeclarationimprovements">details</a>).</li>
  <li>The Resource Chooser can create items such as dimensions, integers, ids, and booleans
  (<a href="http://tools.android.com/recent/resourcechoosercannowcreatearbitraryvalues">details</a>).</li>
  <li>Improvements to the Visual Layout Editor:
      <ul>
        <li>A new Palette with categories and rendering previews
        (<a href="http://tools.android.com/recent/newpalette">details</a>).</li>
        <li>A Layout Actions bar that provides quick access to common layout operations
        (<a href="http://tools.android.com/recent/layoutactionsbar">details</a>).</li>
        <li>When the Android 3.0 rendering library is selected, layouts render more like they do on devices.
        This includes rendering of status and title bars to more accurately reflect the actual
        screen space available to applications
        (<a href="http://tools.android.com/recent/systembarandactionbar">details</a>).</li>
        <li>Zoom improvements such as fit to view, persistent scale, and keyboard access.

ADT 9.0.0</a> <em>(January 2011)</em>
  <div class="toggleme">

<dl>

<dt>Dependencies:</dt>

<dd>ADT 9.0.0 is designed for use with SDK Tools r9. If you haven't
already installed SDK Tools r9 into your SDK, use the Android SDK Manager to do
so.</dd>

<dt>General notes:</dt>
<dd>
  <ul>
    <li>"Go To Declaration" hyperlink support: You can jump directly from code references (such as
    <code>R.id.main</code>) to the corresponding XML declaration, or from XML attributes (such as
    <code>@string</code>) to the corresponding resource definition, or from manifest XML
    registrations to activities and services.</li>
    <li>Improvements were made to name refactoring.</li>
    <li>AVDs now automatically save their state, so they can restart almost instantly. You can enable this feature when
    creating an AVD or by editing an AVD with the AVD Manager.</li>
    <li>Improvements to the Visual Layout Editor:
      <ul>
        <li>Support for rendering targets: You can now choose an arbitrary Android platform to
        render the current page, regardless of the project's minimum platform. This makes it
        easy to verify the layout and appearance of your activity on different versions of
        the platform.
        </li>
        <li>Improved support for empty and nested layouts: Dragging items over nested and
        invisible layouts automatically enlarges and highlights these layouts, so that they
        can receive drops.
        </li>
        <li>XML formatting improvements: The editor generates cleaner XML and you can now enable
        XML auto-formatting in the <strong>Preferences</strong> menu.</li>
        <li>Improved Outline labels: The Outline tab now displays additional information about each
        View. Textual Views display a snippet of the actual text. Views with a source
        (such as ImageView) displays the resource name. Included Views display the name of the View.
        </li>
        <li>When you right click a View in the Layout Editor,
        the context menu now contains <strong>Edit ID...</strong> and <strong>Edit Text...</strong>
        items. The <strong>Properties...</strong> context menus now list all of the properties and
        provide a way to edit them
        (<a href="http://tools.android.com/recent/editidtextandotherpropertiesviamenu">Details</a>).
        </li>
        <li>The layout editor now properly handles
        <a href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/resources/layout-resource.html#include-element"><code>&lt;include&gt;</code></a>
        and <a href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/resources/layout-resource.html#merge-element"><code>&lt;merge&gt;</code></a>
        tags (<a href="http://tools.android.com/recent/supportforincludeandmerge">Details</a>).</li>
        <li>"Extract as Include" refactoring: The Layout Editor has a new refactoring that allows
        you to select one or more views in a layout, and extract it into a separate layout
        (<a href="http://tools.android.com/recent/extractasincluderefactoring">Details</a>).</li>
        <li>Improved diagnostics for class loading and rendering errors: Class loading and rendering
        error messages are more useful and provide better information about the root cause of the
        error.</li>
        <li>Improved error handling to prevent drag and reordering operations from adding children
        into an {@link android.widget.AdapterView}.</li>
        <li>Outline reordering: Reordering your views in the Outline tab is much easier
        (<a href="http://tools.android.com/recent/outlineimprovements">Details</a>).</li>
        <li>Fix for keybinding bug where keyboard shortcuts did not work (Issues
        <a href="http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=13231">13231</a> and
        <a href="http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=13134">13134</a>).</li>
        <li>Fix for problems with Custom layout attribute menu (Issue
        <a href="http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=13134">13134</a>).</li>
        <li>Automatic configuration for various view types: Certain views have properties configured
        by default. For example, the width of an {@link android.widget.EditText} object is set to
        <code>match_parent</code> when added to a vertical {@link android.widget.LinearLayout}
        or a default image is added to an {@link android.widget.ImageButton}.</li>
        <li>Previews during dragging: Dragging from the palette or dragging within the layout editor
        now shows live previews of the dragged item.</li>
        <li>Navigation improvements: In the Layout Editor, double-clicking Views jumps to the
        corresponding XML element. In the Outline view, double-clicking opens the Properties view.</li>
        <li>The editor has Honeycomb style animation preview support.</li>
        <li>Improved rendering support for various Views (such as TabHosts and SlidingDrawers) in
        Honeycomb (Issues <a href="http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=3162">3162</a>
        and <a href="http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=13092">13092</a>).</li>
        <li>Included layouts can be rendered and edited in the context of the layouts that include
        them. From a layout using an <a href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/resources/layout-resource.html#include-element">
        <code>&lt;include&gt;</code></a> tag, double-clicking on the
        <a href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/resources/layout-resource.html#include-element">
        <code>&lt;include&gt;</code></a> element edits the referenced layout in the context of the
        current layout. Additionally, when editing a layout that is included by other layouts,
        you can quickly change between context layouts, by right clicking in the editor and choosing
        <strong>Show included in...</strong>. This feature is only available in Honeycomb.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>This release fixes many other bugs, but the most important ones are listed below:
  <ul>
   <li>Fixed issue that prevented launching debug builds on productions devices when
    <code>debuggable=true</code> was not set in the Android manifest.</li>
    <li>The LogCat view in DDMS properly handles UTF-8 characters.</li>
    <li>The SDK Manager is more reliable on Windows
    (<a href="http://tools.android.com/recent/sdkmanagerfixes">Details</a>).</li>
    <li>A JUnit initialization bug that prevented you from working with JUnit tests was fixed
    (Issue <a href="http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=12411">12411</a>).</li>

<dt>Dependencies:</dt>

<p><p>ADT 8.0.0 is designed for use with SDK Tools r8. If you haven't

<dt>General notes:</dt>
<dd>
<ul>
  <li>New version number scheme that follows the SDK Tools revision number. The major version
number for your ADT plugin should now always match the revision number of your SDK Tools. For
example, ADT 8.x is for SDK Tools r8.</li>
  <li>Support for true debug build. You no longer need to change the value of the
   <code>debuggable</code> attribute in the Android Manifest.
  <p>Incremental builds automatically insert <code>debuggable="true"</code>, but if you perform
  "export signed/unsigned application package", ADT does <em>not</em> insert it.
  If you manually set <code>debuggable="true"</code> in the manifest file, then release builds will
  actually create a debug build (it does not remove it if you placed it there).</p></li>
  <li>Automatic <a href="{@docRoot}tools/help/proguard.html">ProGuard</a> support in
  release builds. For it to work, you need to have a <code>proguard.config</code>

<dt>General notes:</dt>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Adds a new Action, "Rename Application Package", to the Android Tools
contextual menu. The Action does a full application package refactoring.
<li>Adds support for library projects that don't have a source folder
called <code>src/</code>. There is now support for any number of source folders,
with no name restriction. They can even be in subfolder such as
<code>src/java</code>. If you are already working with library projects created
in ADT 0.9.7, see <a
href="{@docRoot}tools/projects/index.html#libraryMigrating">Migrating
library projects to ADT 0.9.8</a> for important information about moving
to the new ADT environment.</li>
<li>Adds support for library projects that depend on other library
projects.</li>
<li>Adds support for additional resource qualifiers:
<code>car</code>/<code>desk</code>, <code>night</code>/<code>notnight</code> and
<code>navexposed</code>/<code>navhidden</code>.</li>
<li>Adds more device screen types in the layout editor. All screen
resolution/density combinations listed in the <a
href="{@docRoot}guide/practices/screens_support.html#range">Supporting
Multiple Screens</a> are now available.</li>
<li>Fixes problems with handling of library project names that
contain characters that are incompatible with the Eclipse path variable.
Now properly sets up the link between the main project and the library
project.</li>

<dt>Library projects:</dt>
<dd>
<p>The ADT Plugin now supports the use of <em>library projects</em> during
development, a capability that lets you store shared Android application
code and resources in a separate development project. You can then reference the
library project from other Android projects and, at build time, the tools
compile the shared code and resources as part of the dependent applications.
More information about this feature is available in the <a
href="{@docRoot}tools/projects/index.html#LibraryProjects">Creating and Managing Projects</a> document. </p>
<p>If you are not developing in Eclipse, <a

project support through the Ant build system.</p>
