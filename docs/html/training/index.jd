<p>Welcome to Android Training. Here you'll find a collection of classes that aim to help you
build great apps for Android, using best practices in a variety of framework topics.</p>

<p>Each class explains the steps required to solve a problem or implement a feature using code
snippets and sample code for you to use in your apps.</p>

<p>What you see now is just the beginning. We plan to add many more classes, expand and refine
existing classes, and build Training Courses that help you enhance your apps using
objective-oriented collections of classes.</p>
