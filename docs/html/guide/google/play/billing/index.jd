<p>In-app Billing is a Google Play service that lets you sell digital content from inside
your applications. You can use the service to sell a wide range of content, including downloadable
content such as media files or photos, virtual content such as game levels or potions, premium services 
and features, and more. You can use In-app Billing to sell products as</p>

<ul>
<li>Standard in-app products (one-time billing), or</li>
<li>Subscriptions, (recurring, automated billing)</li>
</ul>

  <h2>Support for subscriptions <span class="new">New!</span></h2>
  <p>In-app Billing now lets you sell subscriptions in your apps, as well as standard in-app products. 
  For details on how to sell subscriptions to content, services, and features, see the
  <a href="{@docRoot}guide/google/play/billing/billing_subscriptions.html">Subscriptions</a> documentation.</p>

<p>When you use the in-app billing service to sell an item,
whether it's an in-app product or a subscription, Google Play
handles all checkout details so your application never has to directly process
any financial transactions. Google Play uses the same checkout backend service as
is used for application purchases, so your users experience a consistent and
familiar purchase flow (see figure 1). Also, the transaction fee for in-app
purchases is the same as the transaction fee for application purchases
(30%).</p>

<p>Any application that you publish through Google Play can implement In-app Billing. No special
account or registration is required other than an Android Market publisher account and a Google
Wallet Merchant account. Also, because the service uses no dedicated framework APIs, you can add
in-app billing to any application that uses a minimum API level of 4 or higher.</p>

<p>To help you integrate in-app billing into your application, the Android SDK
provides a sample application that demonstrates how to sell standard in-app
products and subscriptions from inside an app. The sample contains examples of
billing-related classes you can use to implement in-app billing in your
application. It also contains examples of the database, user interface, and
business logic you might use to implement in-app billing.</p>

<p class="caution"><strong>Important</strong>: Although the sample application is a working example
of how you can implement in-app billing, we <em>strongly recommend</em> that you modify and
obfuscate the sample code before you use it in a production application. For more information, see
<a href="{@docRoot}guide/google/play/billing/billing_best_practices.html">Security and Design</a>.</p>

  <strong>Figure 1.</strong> Applications initiate in-app billing requests through their own UI
  (first screen). Google Play responds to the request by providing the checkout user interface
  (middle screen). When checkout is complete, the application resumes.
